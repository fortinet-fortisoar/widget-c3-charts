# Overview

The C3 Charts widget helps populate reports and dashboards with charts by taking full advantage of the C3 Javascript Library's flexibility. Once you have created a custom playbook to gather the data and formatted it appropriately, simply point this widget to the module, record, and field storing that data and the chart is rendered appropriately.
